    title: "2. What The Tribunal Is",
    content: `The Tribunal is an independent opinion and polling platform by The Middle East Hustle, focused on the Middle East and North Africa region. We publish poll questions, aggregate anonymous votes, and feature curated profiles of founders, operators, and change-makers ("Voices"). The Tribunal is not a news outlet, financial advisor, or research institution.

    content: `You must be at least 16 years old to use The Tribunal. By using the platform, you represent that you meet this age requirement.

    content: `When you vote on a poll, we collect: your anonymised vote selection, the poll ID and timestamp, your approximate country of origin (derived from your IP address via a third-party geolocation service — your full IP address is never stored). When you submit your email address (via the share gate or newsletter signup), we collect your email and the source of capture. We do not sell your data to third parties. We may use aggregate, anonymised vote data for editorial purposes — for example, publishing "42% of UAE respondents voted X." We retain email addresses for newsletter distribution only and honour all unsubscribe requests immediately.`,

  {
    id: "cookies",
    title: "5. Cookies and Local Storage",
    content: `The Tribunal uses browser localStorage (not third-party cookies) to remember your voting history, theme preference (dark/light), and whether you have unlocked poll results. We do not use tracking pixels, retargeting cookies, or cross-site analytics. If you clear your browser data, your voting history and preferences will reset. We may use first-party analytics (Plausible or similar privacy-preserving tools) to understand aggregate traffic patterns — no personally identifiable information is captured in this process.`,

You retain ownership of your content. You represent that your content is accurate, does not infringe any third-party rights, and does not violate any applicable law. The Tribunal reserves the right to remove, edit, or decline any content at our sole discretion.`,
